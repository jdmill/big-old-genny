## Overview

1. Created password generator.
2. Uses prompts to generate password criteria.
3. Checks to make sure that desired password length is between 8-128 characters
4. Confirms that minimum requirements are met before generation.

## Special Notes.

The only issue encounter in the development of this solution of this problem was a scoping issue. I did not realize it before, but var is a global variable. After some trial and error I debugged and made a modification to the code.
